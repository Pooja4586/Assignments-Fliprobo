      "Alienware, the premium gaming brand from Dell has its own reputation for building some of the meanest gaming machines for more than two decades. The best Alienware gaming laptop featuring an Intel processor is the Alienware x17 R2. This thing packs an Intel Core i9-12900HK which is a 14-Core (6P+8E) processor which has 20 Threads. The lower P-Core count helps it hit slightly higher clock speeds but the Max Turbo power is capped at 115W which is less than what the MSI GT77 sports. As for the graphics card, the Alienware x17 R2 also sports an NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti with the peak TGP set to 175 Watts. The CPU+GPU combination of the Alienware x17 R2 comes close to the MSI GT77. As for the memory, the Alienware x17 R2 ships with 32 GB of DDR5 RAM clocked at 4800 MT/s. The display on the x17 R2 is a 17.3-inch FHD 360 Hz panel compared to the 120 Hz 4K panel on the MSI GT77. You’ll end up seeing higher frame rates on the Alienware x17 R2 without any tearing whereas you’ll see crisper visuals at high frame rates on the MSI GT77. Both make for great experiences. This configuration of the Dell Alienware x17 R2 goes for INR 3,89,990 making it a good gaming laptop to buy in 2022.\n",
      "The Predator lineup from Acer has shown great promise for gamers ever since they showcased the Predator 21X a couple of years ago. Keeping its legacy intact and also being the best Acer gaming laptop featuring an Intel processor is the Acer Predator Triton 500 SE. This machine is powered by an Intel Core i7-12700H which is a 14-Core (6P+8E) processor with 20 Threads. And the graphics card in this machine is the NVIDIA RTX 3070 Ti. The TGP isn’t specified but the RTX 3070 Ti generally ships with a TGP of between 105 to 150 Watts. For the memory, it has 32 GB of LPDDR5 memory clocked at 4800 MT/s and the display is a 16-inch 2560x1600 IPS panel sporting a 240 Hz refresh rate. Acer makes some intelligent decisions with the hardware by picking a Core i7 processor and pairing it with a high-end RTX 3070 Ti. The power backup in this machine is a 4-Cell 99 Wh Li-ion battery which is the highest that you can get in a laptop legally for it to be carried on aeroplanes. And if we are to talk about the networking then the Acer Predator Triton 500 SE comes with Killer Wi-Fi 6E 1675s and Gigabit Ethernet. This laptop gives you great gaming performance that comes close to machines that cost twice as much. Speaking of price, the Acer Predator Triton 500 SE PT516-52s is priced at INR 2,29,999 in India.\n",
      "Omen by HP is a premium gaming lineup which is right up there with their Victus gaming laptops. The best HP gaming laptop with an Intel processor is the Omen by HP (16-B1371TX). Like the Acer Predator, this too is powered by the Intel Core i7-12700H which is a 14-Core (6P+8E) processor with 20 Threads. And the graphics card in this machine is the NVIDIA RTX 3070 Ti. Even the memory is a similar configuration with 32 GB of DDR5 RAM rated for 4800 MT/s. One of the great things about the Omen laptops is that the audio setup is powered by Bang&Olufsen for some really great-sounding audio. For the display, the Omen by HP (16-B1371TX) sports a 16.1-inch 165 Hz 2560x1440 IPS panel that is the best of both worlds, resolution and refresh rate. Moreover, it is also NVIDIA G-Sync certified.

In a way, the HP Omen (16-B1371TX) checks all the boxes and it does so with a price tag of INR 1,82,999 in India.\n",
      "Acer Predator Helios 300 AN515-45 is the best Acer gaming laptop featuring an AMD processor. It is powered by the AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX which is an 8 Core processor that gives you 16 Threads.

The TGP for the RTX 3070 has not been mentioned here but a high TGP RTX 3070 can even best a low TGP RTX 3070 Ti, so there might be a few surprises there. For all these features, the Acer Predator Helios 300 carries a price tag of INR 1,39,990 in India.\n",
      "The best MSI gaming laptop with an AMD processor is the MSI Delta 15 A5EFK-083IN.

The Radeon RX 6000 series graphics cards are well known for their power efficiency thanks to the efficient 7nm process on which the Radeon RX 6000 GPUs are built on. The RX 6700M, in particular, is a great high-end graphics card and can best even an RTX 3070 considering the TGP ranges of the GPUs. For the memory, the MSI Delta 15 comes with 16 GB of dual-channel DDR4 RAM clocked at 3200 MT/s.

It is the best Lenovo gaming laptop featuring AMD hardware. For the processor it has an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H which is an 8-Core / 16-Thread CPU similar to the Ryzen 9 5900HX but with a lower TDP cap and slightly lower clock speeds.
